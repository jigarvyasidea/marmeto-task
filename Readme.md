# Responsive Cart Page

## Objective
This project is a functional and responsive cart page built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It dynamically loads cart items from a provided JSON API and provides essential cart features, including quantity updates, item removal, and price calculations. The page is designed to be responsive across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

## Design Reference
The design for the cart page follows a pre-defined structure and can be accessed via the [Figma link](https://www.figma.com/design/OyvjOBRzxCEtrdE2bltFu8/L%26D-Traineeship-%3C%3E-L2?node-id=0-1&node-type=canvas&t=ul0gvKb8dPNw4p82-0).

## Features

2. **Responsive Layout:**

   - **Remove Item:** Users can remove items from the cart, which updates the totals in real time.

4. **Price Calculation:**
   - Dynamically calculate and display the subtotal for each item and the total price for the entire cart.
   - Prices are displayed in Indian Rupees (â‚¹) with appropriate formatting.

5. **Additional Features:**
